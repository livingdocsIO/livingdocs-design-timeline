# Timeline Design

This design is used as a default design by our free service Livingdocs Beta (https://beta.livingdocs.io)
Feel free to use it as a boilerplate for your own designs.

For an introduction on how to create and work with Livingdocs designs please visit [our documentation](https://github.com/upfrontIO/livingdocs/blob/master/public/design/create_designs.md).
